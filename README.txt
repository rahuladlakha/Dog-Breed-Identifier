NOTE:
Go to "path\DogBreedIdentifierApp\app\src\main\ml\" and add the three tflite model files in the ml directory.
If you cannot find an "ml" directory, create one (in the path above)(this is the same path where you will find java and res directories) and add the three tflite files there.
The three tflite files to be added can be found in the google drive in projects > dogbreedidentifier.
